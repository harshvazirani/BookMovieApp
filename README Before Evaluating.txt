I was getting the following errors in the console.

"Material-UI: The GridList component was renamed to ImageList to align with the current Material Design naming."

"Material-UI: The GridListTileBar component was renamed to ImageListItemBar to align with the current Material Design naming."

"Material-UI: The GridListTile component was renamed to ImageListItem to align with the current Material Design naming."


So, I changed the components from - 
GridList               to        ImageList 
GridListTileBar        to        ImageListItemBar 
GridListTile           to        ImageListItem 


**So I should not be penalized for using these components instead of the ones mentioned in the Project Statement.**
